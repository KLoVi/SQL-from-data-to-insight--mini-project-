# Supermarket Sales Analysis

Using a Supermarkets dataset from Kaggle, containing sales data for 3 branches during 3 months, we address the following business questions: 
1. Which time range of the day are the clients buying more of a product line? 
2. By gender, which range of the day men and female buy more? How much more they buy per gender, per product line?
   
Having clear answers for these questions may lead to appropiate and decision to make more effective marketing campaigns, for example, and maxize resources to be effective to target and understanding the behaviour and preferences of the clients. 
For our project, we started checking general characteristics of the DataSet in Python in order to explore it and evaluate if any cleaning action was needed. Then, we continued with the creation of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) in SQL, defining the data we wanted to retrieve from the original dataset. Then, we proceeded to create and populate a functional database accordingly, followed by the use  of SQL to run queries and start the analysis and find the answers for our business case. Finally we created views in SQL and the exported as .csv in order to used them in Python to encapsulate the main results in graphics.
We found out that men and women buy more at the evening, followed by the early afternon for men and in the morning for women. Female buy more "Food and groceries" and men buy more "health and beauty" products. On the other hand, the bigger amount of sells of the following product lines are during the evening: "food and beverages", "health and beauty", "sports and travel" and "elecrtonic accesories". Altough "fashion accessories" are mostly sold during the morning and "home and lifestyle" are mostly sold during midday.
