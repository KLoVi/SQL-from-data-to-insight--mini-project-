# Supermarket Sales Analysis

This project utilizes a supermarket dataset from Kaggle, containing sales data from three branches over a three-month period, to address key business questions.

**The main objectives of the project are as follows:
1. Determine which time of day sees the highest sales for each product line.
2. Analyze purchasing patterns by gender, including the time of day men and women tend to buy more, and quantify sales differences by product line.**

Understanding these patterns can inform more effective marketing campaigns and optimize resource allocation to better target customer preferences and behaviors.

The project workflow was as follows:

**- Data Exploration: **We started by examining the general characteristics of the dataset in Python to evaluate its quality and determine if any data cleaning was necessary.
**- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** We created an ERD in SQL to define the data to be extracted from the original dataset. A functional database was then created and populated based on this diagram.
**- Data Analysis: **Using SQL, we ran queries to analyze the dataset and answer the key business questions. Views were created in SQL and exported as CSV files for further visualization in Python.
**- Data Visualization:** Python was used to generate graphical representations of the key findings.

Key Insights:

- Men and women tend to buy more in the evening, with men also purchasing more in the early afternoon and women in the morning.
- Women primarily purchase "Food and Groceries," whereas men tend to buy more "Health and Beauty" products.
- The highest sales for "Food and Beverages," "Health and Beauty," "Sports and Travel," and "Electronic Accessories" occur during the evening. "Fashion Accessories" are mostly sold in the morning, and "Home and Lifestyle" products peak at midday.

**These insights can help the business make informed decisions regarding product promotions, inventory management, and customer engagement strategies.
